# Sorcery

Sorcery is a suite of applications for managing system packages...

This is a complete re-write of Sorcery used by Source Mage GNU/Linux.  The original code was done in BASH, this will be in python.  This intended to be a functional dropin replacement, that will work side-by-side with the original sorcery code.  To do so, the commands have been named py<command>.  This version is designed to be flexible enough to work on non-sorcery systems such as Debian/Ubuntu.


## New Commands

### pyarchive
A Universal Compressed File manager.
- Extracts
- Compresses
- List Contents
- Test
- Repack
- Recompress
- Diff
- Search
- Formats
- Add
- Read (compressed File)
This is a bonus application.  Sorcery needed to do these various tasks internally.  I simply added a script that calls these functions directly.

### pyledger
Incorporates ledger directly into sorcery

### pyupstream (I need a new Name)
This program checks upstream versions of software.  Alt generates a new grimoire (Repository) with the latest version on the software.  If using the '--debian' switch will check the version of software in the debian sid repository.

### pycauldron
Create Custom Install Disks

### pyenchant
SMGL installation program

obsolete packages, displaying new packages, untracked files, sections,
searching for files that are installed, finding when spells were
created and packages in the software catalogue. It can even take and
retrieve snap shots of currently installed packages for easy
duplication.
